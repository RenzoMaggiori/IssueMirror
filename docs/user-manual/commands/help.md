## Help Command

The `/help` command provides detailed information about how to use Issue Mirror's commands and features. It's a quick way to get help on specific commands or to see an overview of all available commands.

### Syntax

```plaintext
/help [command-name]
```

- **command-name**: Optional parameter to specify a particular command you want help with. If omitted, it will display a list of all available commands.

### How It Works

1. **General Help**: Without specifying a command, `/help` will list all available commands with brief descriptions.
2. **Specific Command Help**: If you include a command name (e.g., `/help watch`), it will provide detailed usage instructions and examples for that command.

### Example

```plaintext
/help watch
```

This will display detailed information about the `/watch` command, including its syntax, examples, and how to use it.

### Benefits

- **Quick Reference**: Get immediate help on any command without leaving Discord.
